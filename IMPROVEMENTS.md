## 5. 🟢 Transfer policy for slow movers — whole cases only, too-slow → merchant-fulfilled  ·  BUILT + TESTED

DONE (`engine/projection.ts` recommendTransfer):
- **Too slow for FBA** = one whole case > 6 months of cover (~<8/mo). These get **no FBA transfer**
  at all (flag `TOO_SLOW_FOR_FBA`) — left merchant-fulfilled; the China PO still keeps a case in the
  warehouse. Not force-switched to FBM, just never asked to transfer. (Benoit: partial picks to FBA
  are too costly; if demand isn't there, keep it FBM but always stocked at the warehouse.)
- **Whole 50-cases only** for everyone else (dropped the old 6-month partial trim).
- **One exception — true stockout rescue:** FBA would hit zero before a shipment lands AND the
  warehouse can't fill a full case → ship what's on hand (a loose partial beats going dark).
- Removed the old "ship the full loose spare above reserve" behavior.

Verified on live data: 32 SKUs now TOO_SLOW_FOR_FBA (ship 0); FBA transfer volume ~13,900 → 11,100;
partials only for genuine near-zero rescues (93 today, an artifact of the under-stocked catch-up
state — they become whole cases once warehouses refill). 108/108 tests pass; steady state 0 dark
days, ~92% FBA peak (whole-case tradeoff; plan-invariant guard set to the engine's 90% line).

## 4. 🟢 ASIN consolidation — plan duplicate Amazon SKUs as one product  ·  BUILT + TESTED

DONE (`assemble.ts` + `engine/index.ts` + `types.ts`): merchant SKUs sharing an ASIN plan as ONE
unit. The MAPPED SKU is primary; each duplicate folds its demand (summed), warehouse and open POs
onto it, FBA pools are summed but DEDUPED by identical position tuple (shared pool counted once),
and the duplicate is suspended (`consolidated_into`, flag `CONSOLIDATED`, no order of its own).
Coverage (`/api/sku-map`, dashboard) and the export are now ASIN-aware so consolidated SKUs aren't
falsely flagged "missing mapping". Verified on live data: MHD11 velocity 5.53 (115+50) with FBA 388
counted ONCE (not doubled); MBK08-O FBA summed 197 (separate pools); MQB09 consolidates onto mapped
MQBQ09; unmapped-count 7 → 0; 108/108 tests pass. Original write-up below.


**Idea (Benoit):** if an ASIN already has a mapped QALO SKU, any new Amazon SKU under that ASIN should
auto-inherit the same QALO SKU — no manual re-upload every time Amazon spins up a variant listing.

**Validated on prod (v14, 663 mappings):**
- 8 ASINs have 2 catalog Amazon SKUs each (primary + variant: `.1` / `.s` / `NP` / `.missing1` /
  re-created `Stickered.MSKU…`).
- **0 ASINs map to more than one QALO SKU** → the inherit target is always unambiguous; rule is safe.
- **All 7 currently-unmapped active SKUs share an ASIN with a mapped sibling** → this rule fixes 100%
  of today's gap: MHD11.s→MHD11, MBK08-O.1→MBK08-O, MBK11-O.1→MBK11-O, MQB09.1→MQBQ09,
  MQB14.1→MQBQ14, SMB09NP→SMB09, FBA18YPL9799.missing1→MSB11.

**Design note:** `sku_map` is keyed by `qalo_sku` (one Amazon SKU per QALO SKU), so it can't hold a
2nd Amazon SKU for the same QALO product. A *resolution rule* (catalog SKU inherits the QALO SKU of a
mapped ASIN-sibling) is the cheap version — but see the finding below before shipping it.

**FINDING (blocks the naive version):** for these shared-ASIN pairs, BOTH Amazon SKUs are often
actively selling — they're not dead duplicates. Last-30d FBA sales: MHD11 117 + MHD11.s 50;
MQBQ09 19 + MQB09.1 35 (the *unmapped* variant outsells the mapped one!); MBK08-O 59 + .1 3;
MBK11-O 88 + .1 0; MSB11 40 + .missing1 10; SMB09 17 + NP 4. So the ASIN's real demand is SPLIT
across two catalog rows and warehouse feeds only one. A label-only "inherit by ASIN" would turn the
coverage warning green while leaving split demand + stranded warehouse unfixed → masks the problem.

**Correct fix:** treat all Amazon SKUs under one ASIN as ONE planning unit — sum demand, share
warehouse/inventory, plan once. Bigger engine change; build + test before deploying, do NOT rush.
Interim safe option: change the warning to flag "duplicate Amazon SKUs under one ASIN" so dead ones
can be set to `ignore` and the genuinely-split ones (MHD11, MQB09) handled consciously.

## 3. 🟡 Rock-solid SKU mapping — coverage warning + validation export + warehouse fix  ·  DEPLOYED (v11)

Built + verified against a copy of live data (all 108 tests pass):
- **Warehouse import fix** (`warehouse.ts`): NetSuite rows now translate QALO→Amazon via `sku_map`
  before matching; unmatched-with-stock rows are surfaced, not dropped. Verified: NetSuite `MBK09-O`
  646 → lands on `MBK09-O.s`, its China order dropped **500 → 0**; a non-catalog junk row was reported
  as skipped. 1→many maps sum instead of overwrite.
- **Coverage warning** (`sku-map.ts` `GET /api/sku-map` + Imports UI + Action Center "to-do first"
  gate via `dashboard.ts` `unmapped_skus` + Dashboard.tsx): shows "N of M products have no QALO↔Amazon
  mapping" on the Imports page AND "N missing a SKU mapping" in the Action Center to-do strip; warns
  loudly but keeps planning (per Benoit). Verified: 501/501 unmapped (empty) → 1/501 after a mapping;
  Action Center to-do shows 501.
- **Validation export** (`GET /api/sku-map/export.csv` + Imports button): every product with QALO SKU,
  Amazon SKU, ASIN, Mapped?, warehouse qty, classification; flags stale mappings too.

STILL TO DO before this helps in production:
- **Deploy** — prod is a schema version behind and has no `sku_map` at all; none of this is live yet.
- **Upload the REAL mapping** — my local test used a mapping *derived* by stripping ".s"; the true one
  (and oddballs like `FBA18YPL9799.missing1`, `MSC14.`) must come from Benoit's master list.
- **Clean malformed catalog identities** (`.missing1`, trailing `.`) — the export now makes them visible.

## 2. 🟢 Fix NetSuite → SKU warehouse mapping (warehouse stock silently orphaned)  ·  FIXED (folded into #3), pending deploy

**What's wrong (VERIFIED in code):** the QALO↔Amazon SKU mapping IS provided and works for the
*display* (assemble.ts `qaloOf`) — but it is **never applied during the NetSuite warehouse import**.
`server/routes/warehouse.ts:37` matches each NetSuite row's SKU against the catalog by **exact string
equality** and silently `continue`s (drops it) on no match:
`if (!known.has(row.sku)) continue;`. So NetSuite `MBK09-O` (646 units) doesn't match the catalog key
`MBK09-O.s` → the 646 is skipped → engine reads warehouse = **0**. Its sibling `MBK08-O` is stored plain
in the catalog, matches, and lands fine — which is why only some sizes break.
The mapping is half-wired: display/engine identity use it; the warehouse importer does not.
(Earlier I wrongly blamed an "empty sku_map" — that was an analysis error on a stale DB copy.)

**Why it matters:** the tool thinks these SKUs have no warehouse stock, so it re-orders them from China —
stock you already own. This is real over-ordering, not a rounding artifact.

**Impact (live data):** 22 SKUs affected, **19 in the current China PO, ~6,850 units** ordered while
warehouse shows 0. Includes real movers: MHD10 (ordering 1,600), MHD11 (950), MHD09 (950), SMB05 (550),
MBK09-O (500 — while ~646 sit in the warehouse). Also several malformed identities to clean up
(`FBA18YPL9799.missing1`, `MSC14.` with a trailing dot).

**Fix:** apply the QALO↔Amazon map inside the warehouse import — translate each NetSuite row's SKU to
the catalog key before the `known.has(...)` check and upsert (`warehouse.ts:37-38`). Also: (a) surface
skipped/unmatched NetSuite rows in the import result instead of dropping them silently, and (b) make
sure the mapping (`sku_map`) is actually populated & persisted in the deployed env (prod DB pulled this
session had no `sku_map` table — schema was a version behind the current code, so the fix isn't deployed).
Then re-run and confirm MBK09-O etc. show their real warehouse stock and their China orders drop.

**Found by:** Benoit spotted MBK09-O showing 646 in NetSuite but 0 in the tool — correct instinct; my
first root-cause was wrong, the verified cause is warehouse.ts:37 not applying the mapping.

## 1. 🟢 Smarter order rounding — round to the nearest case of 50, not always up  ·  BUILT + TESTED, pending deploy

DONE in `engine/projection.ts`: added `roundTo` (round half-up) and switched `recommendPo` from
`ceilTo` to `roundTo` (transfers still use `ceilTo`). MOQ-50 floor intact. Verified: ~9% fewer China
units (6,750 on the current dataset) from cases that were barely over a line; 108/108 tests pass
including the plan-invariant stockout guards. Original write-up below.


**What's wrong:** once the tool decides to order a SKU, it floors to the 50 MOQ and then rounds **up**
to the next 50 (`ceilTo`, `server/projection.ts:132`). So a true need of 53 becomes 100, and 101 becomes
150 — a whole extra case for being barely over a line.

**Proposed change:** keep the 50-unit MOQ floor (one case is the real China minimum), but round to the
**nearest** 50 instead of up. 16 → 50, 53 → 50, 74 → 50, 75 → 100, 101 → 100, 126 → 150.

**Impact (live data, estimated):** ~**6,400 units (9%)** off the order across 128 SKUs, all in the
"barely over a case" zone. Does NOT touch trickle SKUs (a need of 16 still becomes 50 — one case is the
true minimum, correct to keep them in stock, e.g. SMB04 which sold out under the team's plan).

**Tradeoff:** rounding down can leave a SKU up to ~24 units under target — weeks of cover for a slow
mover, <1 week for a fast one. Safe. Optional refinement: round-up only for the few highest-velocity SKUs.

**Fix:** one-line change (`ceilTo` → round-to-nearest) in `server/projection.ts`, then run `npm test`
(the plan-invariants suite guards against introducing stockouts).

**Found by:** Benoit — "if we need 53, stay at 50; if we need 75, bump to 100."
